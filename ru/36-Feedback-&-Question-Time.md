I am new to RPi. It is great. Thanks for your mag. I download it and then transfer to my Kindle where it is easy to
read.

Very well done for everything Raspberry Pi that you are doing. I am finding it very interesting and informative.

Thanks you for the great project regarding the pi magazine. When I was a child my father used to buy
these kind of magazines and I miss them, not only for me, but for the new children who think the only OS in existence is that thing called windows, and when they look at linux just don't know what to do, even when they are computer related students. Don't askwhen they are confronted with the command line.

I have read your current issues of the mag and am delighted with it. It has been a while since this sort of publication was available, and I have been wanting to get into programming for years, even up to the point of attending college. But with this I can study at my own pace and start my own projects. I don't have a pie as of yet, but intend to buy the starter pack from Maplin as soon as I can. Again, thanks.

I was wondering if I could write for The Mag Pi magazine, I love the magazine, and I of course love technology and writing. I was also one of the first Raspberry Pi users. Thank you.

introduction for students, and also hobbyists to the wonderful world of Raspberry Pi. Believe me when I say, you are helping create the next generation of Engineersm makers, hackers, and artists. Keep up the greatwork.
